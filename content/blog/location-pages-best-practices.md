## The quick answer

Location pages work when each page contains local proof, unique details, and clear services.

## What to include

- Services offered in that location
- Local FAQs
- Testimonials/case studies
- Internal links to the main service pillar

## Avoid duplication

Use canonicals carefully: [Canonical tags](/blog/canonical-tags).
