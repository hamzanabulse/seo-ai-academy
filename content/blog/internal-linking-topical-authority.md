## The principle

Google understands topics through **relationships**. Internal links are how you declare those relationships.

## A simple cluster model

- 1 pillar page (broad)
- 5–15 supporting pages (specific)
- 2–5 links per page to related pages

## Link rules

- Link when it helps the reader (contextual)
- Use descriptive anchor text (not “click here”)
- Keep your important pages within 2–3 clicks from home

## Maintenance

Every time you publish a new article:

1) add 3–5 internal links from older posts → the new post
2) add 3–5 links from the new post → older supporting posts
