## The quick answer

If you have lots of thin pages, your good pages suffer. Pruning can raise overall quality signals.

## What to prune

- Pages with no traffic and no purpose
- Duplicate topics
- Outdated pages that can be merged

## Pruning process

1) Export URLs and traffic
2) Decide: keep / merge / redirect / delete
3) Update internal links (see: [Internal linking](/blog/internal-linking-topical-authority))
