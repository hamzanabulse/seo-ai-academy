## The quick answer

Track outcomes, not vanity metrics. Rankings alone don’t pay the bills.

## Metrics to track

- Organic sessions (trend)
- Conversions from organic
- Top landing pages
- Branded vs non‑branded queries (in Search Console)

## Also track AI impact

If AI Overviews reduce clicks, measure it per page: [AI Overviews SEO](/blog/ai-overviews-seo).
