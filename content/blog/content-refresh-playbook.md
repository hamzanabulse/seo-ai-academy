## The quick answer

Refreshing content often beats publishing new posts because you keep the existing URL history.

## The playbook

1) Update the first 200 words (answer-first)
2) Add 3–5 new internal links to related pages
3) Improve headings (H2/H3) and add an FAQ
4) Add examples or small tests (experience)

## Internal linking rule

Every refresh should strengthen the cluster. Use this guide: [Topical authority & internal linking](/blog/internal-linking-topical-authority).
