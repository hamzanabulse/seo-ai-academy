## The quick answer

In 2026, a keyword is not just volume — it’s **intent + SERP features + AI answers**.

## The method

- Group keywords by intent (informational / commercial / transactional)
- Check if AI Overviews appear (see: [AI Overviews SEO](/blog/ai-overviews-seo))
- Target complex queries where AI can’t fully answer

## Close the loop

Once you publish, connect it into your cluster: [Internal linking](/blog/internal-linking-topical-authority).
