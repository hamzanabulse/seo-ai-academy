## The quick answer

Start with schema that improves understanding, not gimmicks: **Organization**, **Breadcrumb**, and **Article**. Add **FAQ** when it genuinely helps.

## What to implement first

1) Organization / Website
2) BreadcrumbList
3) Article (or BlogPosting)
4) FAQPage (only for real FAQs)

## Pair it with structure

Schema works best when your content is well structured: [On-page SEO quick guide](/blog/on-page-seo-quick).
