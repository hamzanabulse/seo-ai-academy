## The quick answer

To get cited in AI Overviews, you need **clear answers**, **evidence**, and **trust signals**. Write content that is easy for machines to parse and strong enough for humans to trust.

## Why AI Overviews reduce clicks

AI Overviews often satisfy the query on Google. That means fewer clicks—unless your page is **cited** or the query is **complex**.

## The citation checklist

### 1) Put the answer first

Start with a 2–4 sentence answer. Then expand.

### 2) Use scannable structure

- Short paragraphs
- Lists
- Tables for comparisons
- Consistent headings (H2/H3)

### 3) Add “anti‑AI” signals

AI can summarize, but it can’t *experience*. Add:

- first‑hand notes
- screenshots
- original examples
- real numbers (even small experiments)

### 4) Build internal topical support

Create supporting pages and link them together.

### 5) Strengthen E‑E‑A‑T

- Author bio
- Editorial policy
- Update timestamps
- Clear sources for claims
