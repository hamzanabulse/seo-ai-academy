## The quick answer

Technical SEO is about making your site easy to **crawl**, **index**, and **render** — fast.

## Checklist (fast wins)

### Crawl & index

- Submit `sitemap.xml` and keep it updated
- Make sure important pages are not `noindex`
- Fix redirect chains
- Remove/merge thin pages (see: [E‑E‑A‑T checklist](/blog/eeat-checklist))

### Site architecture

- Keep important pages within 2–3 clicks
- Use internal linking clusters (see: [Topical authority](/blog/internal-linking-topical-authority))

### Speed (Core Web Vitals)

- Compress images
- Reduce heavy scripts
- Avoid layout shifts (CLS)
